# Proposed Project Idea - Master's Practicum

Cory Leigh Rahman • 2020-05-31 • GEOG 778: Practicum in GIS Development

Master's in GIS and Web Map Programming, University of Wisconsin-Madison

## What **problem** will be solved?

1. Having quick and easy access to COVID-19 trends in "my" local area (from the perspective of the user)
2. Having the ability to see how COVID-19 has spread throughout the U.S. over time

## Who is the **audience**?

- U.S. Residents

## Where is the **data**?

- COVID-19 confirmed case numbers will be sourced from [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
  - Time series: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series
- County and state polygon information will be sourced from the [Esri Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/)
  - Counties:https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7566e0221e5646f99ea249a197116605
  - States: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=99fd67933e754a1181cc755146be21ca
- More data may be integrated at the county-level and as needed or useful

## What will the **final product** look like?

The final product envisioned is a time-slider-based interactive map to show the acceleration of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Additional features of the app include map animation to show change-over-time, a robust URL scheme so people can bookmark and share specific places and time-ranges within the U.S., and possibly some sort of annotation or story feature for commentary.

## What **skills** will this project require?

- **Full-stack programming** for application development, database design, and app deployment
- **Cartography & UI/UX Design** for proper, usable, and useful data visualization
- **Data Science** for automation of data acquisition, processing, and analysis
- **Project Management** for the successful and efficient completion of a large, semester-long project
