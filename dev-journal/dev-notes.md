# Development Notes: COVID-19 Trend Map

## Continuous Development

- `npm i` Installs dependencies
- `ng build` Updates the dist folder
- `heroku local` Starts the app in a local server
  - Useful for back-end testing; must use if there is no mockdata
  - Port 5000 is default: http://localhost:5000
  - Requires `ng build --watch` to also be running so that source code changes are visible on browser tab reload
  - Alternative command: `npm start`
- `ng serve` Starts the app in a local server
  - Useful for front-end testing
  - Port 4200 is default: http://localhost:4200, but can be changed like `--port 4201`

## Analysis Documentation

County map layer with size reduction (7.8 MB > 2.2 MB) process:

  1. Pull Esri's "USA Counties (Generalized)" from the Living Atlas
  2. Fix the layer's geometry by importing & exporting from GRASS via QGIS, then running QGIS's "Fix geometries" tool
  3. Dissolve based on FIPS to turn the resulting Polygon layer back into a MultiPolygon
  4. Export as GeoJSON with only Name, FIPS, and POPULATION; set coordinate precision to 2
