# Development Notes: COVID-19 Trend Map

## Continuous Development

Follow these steps to get the app up-and-running after a fresh clone

1. `npm ci` Installs dependencies exactly according to the `package-lock.json`
2. Update the gitignored `.env` file with the necessary config vars/keys:
   - `heroku config:get DATABASE_URL -s  >> .env`
3. `heroku local` serves Angular's build folder (`dist/`) locally with Heroku connections (config vars, database, etc)
   - Useful for full-stack testing
   - The current app build is available on localhost port 5000 by default: http://localhost:5000
4. `ng build --watch` creates an app build in the `dist/` folder
   - After source code changes simply refresh the page to see updates (thanks to the `--watch` flag)

Other commands:

- `ng serve` is also useful to start the front-end in a local server
  - Useful for front-end testing, but will it will be cut off from the server
  - Port 4200 is default: http://localhost:4200, but can be changed like `ng s --port 4201`
- `npm start` can be used as an alternative to `heroku local`, but heroku-specific tools will not be accessible

## Analysis Documentation

County map layer with size reduction (7.8 MB > 2.2 MB) process:

  1. Pull Esri's "USA Counties (Generalized)" from the Living Atlas
  2. Fix the layer's geometry by importing & exporting from GRASS via QGIS, then running QGIS's "Fix geometries" tool
  3. Dissolve based on FIPS to turn the resulting Polygon layer back into a MultiPolygon
  4. Export as GeoJSON with only Name, FIPS, and POPULATION; set coordinate precision to 2

    - [x] Review all feedback received, pick feedback to address, create actionable tasks, triage
    - [ ] (triaged feedback)
  - [x] [Deliverable] Write and deliver Status Report #2

- **Week 5** (7/13 - 7/19)
  - [x] Architect database to store COVID-19 data
  - [x] Automate data calls to update the database daily
  - [x] Re-route data pulls to come from the database

  - [ ] Socialize & advertize the application publicly

- **Scope Creep**
  - [x] Teach Diego to differentiate "zero" (`0`) values between "has never had a new case", "back to no new cases", and the magnitude of "back to no new cases" (e.g. "no new cases in x weeks")
  - [ ] Automatically acquire the user's location using their device's GPS
  - [ ] Add death and recovery statistics
  - [ ] Add state-level aggregations and borders
  - [ ] Add national aggregation
  - [ ] Make the app accessible so people with disabilities can find out the same information.
  - [ ] Add generalized Puerto Rico counties to GeoJSON (Hopkins has their data in the US csv but Esri doesn't in their counties layer, so I'll need to add them and their populations myself)
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for historical COVID-19 data, load on opening of the historical data section

## Triage

Crunch time 2020-08-06 - 2020-08-09

- [x] [functional] State & National data integrated
- [ ] [functional] Time-enable status reports, make animation more efficient by only updating popups on pause, only update status report if it's already open, and add time-stop parameter to URL scheme (will need radio button for "latest data available" vs "this date")
- [ ] [design] Improve UI (organize UI, add a "find a status report" type section)
- [ ] [functional] Automatically acquire user's location on "find me" click
- [ ] [functional] Death & Recovery integration
- [ ] [functional] Validate all aggregations (do manual math against origin CSVs, document process and findings)
- [ ] [follow-through] Get mentor/peer feedback
- [ ] [design/debugging] Ensure mobile-friendliness
- [ ] [debugging] Ensure cross-browser compatibility & stress testing
- [ ] [follow-through] In-app documentation (about, data source, disclaimers, resources, etc)
- [ ] [functional] Lazy-load historic data
- [ ] [functional] Add Puerto Rico
