# Report Notes

- What my COVID-19 Trend Map brings is clear messaging through good UX/UI and good Cartography
  - Comparison with the JHU U.S. Dashboard: [Johns Hopkins Launches New U.S. COVID-19 Map (Apr 14, 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kZDXeJW6BM)
    - JHU does an incredible job aggregating and disseminating COVID-19 data, but it falls short in representing that information to the general public or everyday person.
    - The map has no search capability, people can't quickly or easily find where they live
    - The COVID-19 [Status Report for each county/city](http://bao.arcgis.com/covid-19/jhu/county/24510.html) is too detailed and overwhelms the everyday person with information
