## Introduction

This is a User Testing Guide for the COVID-19 Trend Map application. As of July 5, 2020, the app is still early in development. You will see "placeholders" for elements yet to be created and you may encounter bugs as well.

Please complete the following Task List and Feedback Questionnaire.

## Task List

Goal A) Access the app

1. Use a Desktop or Laptop computer
2. Open Google Chrome or Safari
   - Edge and Firefox are not tested yet but they may work too
3. Navigate to the app's testing URL: [https://covid-19-trend-map.herokuapp.com/](https://covid-19-trend-map.herokuapp.com/). The app may take a moment to load up the first time since it's on free hosting and the server "sleeps".
   - **Note:** Please do not share this app URL just yet since it's still in development

Goal B) Find COVID-19 trends for your local area

1. Locate the *Search Bar* at the top of the map, under the app title bar
2. Type in the name of your local Town, City, or County
3. Select an option using Enter or clicking an item from the list
4. Read all the information in the resulting *Status Report* on the left
5. In the map, click on counties surrounding yours to see quick snapshots of their information

Goal C) Find local COVID-19 information for friends, family, and places you may have heard about in the news

1. Use the *Search Bar* to search for other places you may have friends or family
2. Imagine clicking a "Share" button to bookmark a specific *Status Report* for your own reference
3. Imagine clicking a "Share" button to share a specific *Status Report* with a family member

Goal D) Explore Nationwide Trends

1. Type "usa" in the *Search Bar* at the top of the page
2. Take time to take in and explore the map
3. Search for some notable places such as "Miami, Florida" or "Houston, Texas"

Goal E) Try to break it!

1. Put strange things into the *Search Bar*
2. Move the map in erratic ways
3. Do anything else you think might "break" the app

## Questionnaire

Please return your answers to these questions by copy-pasting them into a document or email, then answering below each one.

1. How fast were you able to find the *Status Report* for your local area?
2. Did you have difficulty finding a *Status Report* for any area?
3. How informative was the information presented in the *Status Report*?
4. What other information would be useful the *Status Report*? Please mark which suggestions you think are **need-to-have** vs **nice-to-have**.
5. How easy was it to explore the map?
6. What trends did you notice in the map?
7. What is one thing you learned from using this app?
8. How could you see yourself using direct links to specific *Status Reports*?
