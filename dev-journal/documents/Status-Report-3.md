## Introduction

This is the third of four status reports on the development progress of the COVID-19 Trend Map application ([Project Plan](./Project-Plan-Geog778-2020-06-14-Cory-Leigh-Rahman.md)). The project is **on schedule** because primary planned tasks for Weeks 3 through 6 have been completed.

  - [x] Update application to address feedback from Beta #1

- **Week 5** (7/13 - 7/19)
  - [x] Architect database to store COVID-19 data
  - [x] Automate data calls to update the database daily
  - [x] Re-route data pulls to come from the database

## Challenges & Contingencies


## Next Steps

As seen in the [Dev Notes Timeline](/dev-journal/dev-notes.md#timeline--to-do), the following are my goals for the next 2 weeks.

- **Week 6** (7/20 - 7/26)
  - [ ] Add "about", tutorial, data source, and disclaimer information
  - [ ] Solicit feedback for Beta #2 from mentors, peers, and additional testers

- **Week 7** (7/27 - 8/2)
  - [ ] Update application to address feedback from Beta #2
  - [ ] Conduct final UX, UI, & responsive design review
  - [ ] Conduct final bug review
  - [ ] Conduct final cross-browser compatibility review

- **Week 8** (8/3 - 8/9)
  - [ ] Launch final application with custom URL and paid Heroku tier for performance
  - [ ] [Deliverable] Plan, record, post, and deliver final video demo & application URL
  - [ ] [Deliverable] Write and deliver Status Report #4

I will also try to include as many additional tasks as possible:

- **Scope Creep**
  - [ ] Automatically acquire the user's location using their device's GPS
  - [ ] Make the app accessible so people with disabilities can find out the same information.
  - [ ] Add generalized Puerto Rico counties to GeoJSON (Hopkins has their data in the US csv but Esri doesn't in their counties layer, so I'll need to add them and their populations myself)
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for historical COVID-19 data, load on opening of the historical data section
