## Purpose

This project is meant to encourage our fellow U.S. Citizens to take COVID-19 more seriously by enabling direct access to local, easy-to-understand COVID-19 trends.

Many people see a statistic on the national News such as "there have now been 5 million cases in the US" and find it hard to personally connect to that number. It's hard to conceptualize. However, when someone sees "*Your County* is reporting 500 new cases of COVID-19 in the past week", that's a lot easier to connect to and comprehend.

## Solution

The ***COVID-19-Watch*** application was developed and is available at [www.covid-19-watch.com](https://www.covid-19-watch.com) (and [covid-19-watch.herokuapp.com](http://covid-19-watch.herokuapp.com) for easier access behind firewalls). The app is free and open source, anyone can [view the Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/CoryLR/COVID-19-Trend-Map).

| COVID-19-Watch Home Screen                           | Local Status Report                                        |

This app allows the public to:

1. Quickly find and share local COVID-19 trends
2. Explore local and national trends
3. Explore how COVID-19 has progressed over time

### How To: Quickly find and share local COVID-19 trends

- Search for your town or city to get a localized Status Report
- Send a direct link to any particular Status Report

| ![Search for a Local Status Report](img/function1-find-and-share-1.jpg) | ![View Status Report](img/function1-find-and-share-2.jpg) | ![Share Direct URL to Status Report](img/function1-find-and-share-3.jpg) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search for a Local Status Report                                        | View Status Report                                        | Share Direct URL to Status Report                                        |

### How To: Explore local and national trends

- Examine the change in colors in the map
- View neighboring, State and National Status Reports

| ![Fairfax County Status Report](img/function2-scale-1.jpg)                       | ![Virginia Status Report](img/function2-scale-2.jpg)                         | ![US Status Report](img/function2-scale-3.jpg)                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fairfax County had 51.5 cases per 100k in the week leading up to August 16, 2020 | Virginia had 77.1 cases per 100k, a slightly higher rate than Fairfax County | The County and State were both beating the national average of 110.9 cases per 100k |

### How To: Explore how COVID-19 has progressed over time

- Use the time-slider to step the entire app back in time
- Use the Play button to watch change-over-time in the map and open Status Report

| ![March 21, 2020](img/function3-change-over-time-1.jpg) | ![March 28, 2020](img/function3-change-over-time-2.jpg) | ![April 4, 2020](img/function3-change-over-time-3.jpg) | ![April 11, 2020](img/function3-change-over-time-4.jpg) |

## Understanding the Data

All information is calculated from raw COVID-19 case and death data provided by [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://systems.jhu.edu/) (Direct link to the raw data source: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). This Johns Hopkins dataset is highly regarded as one of the best sources of COVID-19 data (Source: [*COVID-19 deaths and cases: how do sources compare?*, Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-sources-comparison)).

### Data Flow:

1. Raw COVID-19 data are automatically scraped from Johns Hopkins every morning around 3am by **Diego the Data Broker**, a web robot developed to support COVID-19-Watch.
2. For every county, every state, the nation, and for every week since the data begins, Diego calculates and records:
   - Cumulative count of COVID-19 cases (used to calculate other case stats)
   - Case rate (7-day average of new COVID-19 cases)
   - Case rate, population-normalized (7-day average of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people)
   - Acceleration (Change in 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases from 2 weeks prior)
   - Acceleration, population-normalized (Change in 7-day average of new COVID-19 cases from 2 weeks prior per 100,000 people)
   - Recovery streak (Number of weeks since the last reported case of COVID-19)
   - Cumulative count of COVID-19 deaths (used to calculate other deaths stats)
   - Death rate (7-day average of new COVID-19 deaths)
   - Death rate, population-normalized (7-day average of new COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people)
   <!-- - Death acceleration (Change in 7-day average of new COVID-19 deaths from 2 weeks prior) -->
   <!-- - Death acceleration, normalized (Change in 7-day average of new COVID-19 deaths from 2 weeks prior per 100,000 people) -->
3. This data is added to a Data Package alongside county, state, and national GeoJSON map files and added to the database.
4. When a member of the public accesses the app online, Diego takes the morning's latest Data Package and gives it to the app for display in the map and Status Reports.
